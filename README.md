# Speech Recognition Project

## Overview

This Python project leverages various speech recognition libraries to convert audio input into text. It supports both real-time audio input and the option to upload audio files for transcription. The primary aim is to provide a versatile and user-friendly tool for converting spoken words into written text.

## Features

- Real-time Audio Input: Capture and transcribe live audio through the microphone.
- Audio File Upload: Allow users to upload audio files for transcription.
- Multiple Speech Recognition Libraries: Utilize different libraries, including Whisper ASR, Google Speech-to-Text, CMU Sphinx, and Mozilla DeepSpeech, to provide users with options.
- User Interface: Built with a simple and intuitive interface using Python, PyCharm, and GUI libraries if applicable.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling to manage API failures, audio processing issues, and edge cases.
- Documentation: Comprehensive documentation to guide users on setup, usage, and customization.

## Libraries Used

- Whisper ASR: OpenAI's Automatic Speech Recognition API.
- Google Speech-to-Text: Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API for transcription.
- CMU Sphinx: A speech recognition system developed by Carnegie Mellon University.
- Mozilla DeepSpeech: An open-source ASR engine based on deep learning.
